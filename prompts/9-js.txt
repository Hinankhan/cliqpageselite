Generate ONLY the JAVASCRIPT section that creates a fully functional landing page.

ANALYZE THE PROVIDED HTML STRUCTURE AND CREATE VANILLA JAVASCRIPT FOR:

1. **NAVIGATION & MOBILE MENU**
   - Smooth scroll for anchor links (all sections: #problem, #how-it-works, #features, #product-showcase, #value-props, #pricing, #contact)
   - MOBILE HAMBURGER MENU functionality:
     - Toggle mobile menu visibility with hamburger button
     - Smooth slide-down/fade-in animation for mobile menu
     - Close menu when clicking outside or on menu links
     - Proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
     - Handle data-mobile-menu targeting
   - Header hide/show on scroll
   - Mobile-responsive behavior

2. **CAROUSEL/SLIDER FUNCTIONALITY** 
   - Pure vanilla JS carousel for testimonials (NO Swiper or external libraries)
   - CRITICAL: Use 0-based indexing (data-slide="0,1,2" and data-carousel-dot="0,1,2")
   - Initialize first slide properly with showSlide(0)
   - Auto-play with pause on hover
   - Manual navigation with dots/arrows
   - Touch/swipe support for mobile
   - Proper dot state management (active/inactive)

3. **INTERACTIVE ELEMENTS**
   - FAQ accordion (one open at a time)
   - Pricing toggle (monthly/yearly)
   - Contact form validation and submission
   - Loading states and success messages

4. **ANIMATIONS & EFFECTS**
   - Intersection Observer for scroll animations
   - Smooth reveal animations
   - Hover effects and micro-interactions

5. **FORM HANDLING**
   - Real-time validation
   - Error states
   - Success feedback
   - Loading spinners

MOBILE MENU SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Target hamburger button and mobile menu using data attributes
- Toggle 'hidden' class for show/hide functionality
- Add smooth transitions (transform, opacity)
- Close menu when clicking on navigation links
- Close menu when clicking outside the menu area
- Handle responsive behavior (auto-close on resize to desktop)

CAROUSEL SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- MUST use 0-based indexing system (start from 0, not 1)
- Initialize carousel with showSlide(0) to display first slide
- Handle data-slide="0", data-slide="1", data-slide="2" properly
- Handle data-carousel-dot="0", data-carousel-dot="1", data-carousel-dot="2" properly
- Update dot appearance to show active state (darker color for active dot)

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- **NO external libraries** (NO jQuery, NO Swiper, NO AOS, etc.)
- **Pure vanilla JavaScript** only
- **Performance optimized** with event delegation
- **Mobile responsive** with touch support
- **Error handling** for missing elements
- **Accessibility friendly** with proper ARIA attributes
- **Cross-browser compatible**

IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:
- Analyze actual HTML structure provided above
- Use querySelector/querySelectorAll for existing elements only
- Add proper error checking for missing elements
- Use modern ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions, etc.)
- Optimize for performance with throttling/debouncing
- Add smooth transitions with CSS classes
- Ensure all carousels work properly with correct indexing
- Implement responsive mobile menu with smooth animations
- Handle navigation to all sections (problem, how-it-works, features, product-showcase, value-props, pricing, contact)

OUTPUT FORMAT: Single <script> tag with all functionality consolidated and well-organized.
