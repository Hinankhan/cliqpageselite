Generate the complete HTML document structure with <head> section for {companyName}.

STRUCTURE REQUIRED:
- Complete HTML5 DOCTYPE declaration
- <html> and <head> opening tags
- Meta tags for SEO, responsive viewport, theme-color using {primaryColor}
- Title: "{companyName} - {businessDescription}"
- Link to Google Fonts (professional fonts like Inter, Poppins)
- IMPORTANT: Include Tailwind CSS from CDN for utility classes
- Complete <style> tag with ALL additional CSS for the entire page including:
  - CSS root variables using {primaryColor} and {secondaryColor}
  - Any custom styles that Tailwind doesn't cover
  - Smooth scroll behavior and enhanced animations
  - Custom keyframes: fade-in, slide-up, float, shimmer, glow
  - Form styles if {formIntegration} is yes
  - Any section-specific custom styles not covered by Tailwind
- Close </head> and open <body>

CRITICAL: Include Tailwind CSS CDN link before the custom <style> tag so utility classes work properly. The sections will use Tailwind classes extensively.

The CSS should be complete and ready for all sections. Use {primaryColor} and {secondaryColor} consistently throughout.
